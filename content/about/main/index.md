  I am a recovering academic researcher. My dissertation, under the guidance of Dr. Anna Dornhaus, focused on how the shapes of ant nests affect how they behave, and addressed links between animal and human architectures. I am actively involved in R programming consultation and workshops, statistical training, and collaborative, reproducible research.
