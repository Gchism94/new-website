excerpt: Throughout my teaching tenure, I have discovered the uniqueness and diversity that students
possess, not only in their backgrounds, interests, and aptitude to learn, but also their accessibility to
materials, software, and professional connections. It is my desire to create a safe and open learning
environment that engages and nurtures students and provides both free and inter-operable materials.
I also believe in individual mentorship to provide every student with equal opportunity to succeed
when navigating the professional world.

Throughout my teaching tenure, I have discovered the uniqueness and diversity that students
possess, not only in their backgrounds, interests, and aptitude to learn, but also their accessibility to
materials, software, and professional connections. It is my desire to create a safe and open learning
environment that engages and nurtures students and provides both free and inter-operable materials.
I also believe in individual mentorship to provide every student with equal opportunity to succeed
when navigating the professional world. Access to higher education does not guarantee equity
amongst students, and underrepresented populations, such as those in Tucson, AZ, do not have
access to the same opportunities as those more privileged. I believe that I can guide these students
compassionately through universally accessible learning and by connecting them with professionals
who have successfully undergone their journey.

I believe that there are five essential elements towards successfully teaching across diversity. (1) The
teacher should utilize free and open source materials. (2) Teachers must use inter-operable methods
that work for all students. (3) The teacher should make the student the hero by harnessing their
perspectives, interests, and backgrounds. (4) The teacher must provide equal opportunity to for
student success, including professional development. (5) The teacher must ensure that the hero
(students) will leave their class with the confidence to apply what they learned to the real world.

excerpt: This collaborative project aims to describe the genomic epidemiology of continued disease transmission of *P. falciparum* in Ecuador after considerable progress towards elimination in previous years. By applying novel genetic tools, we aim to better understand factors underlying continued transmission after an outbreak in Ecuador by investigating parasite microevolution and transmission dynamics to inform whether malaria cases in Ecuador are locally-acquired or imported from neighboring countries.
